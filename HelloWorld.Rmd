## R Markdown

This is an **R Markdown** document that I created. I have *knitted* it as a **Word** document. I have included **bold** and Italic* styles to practice markdown code. 



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
